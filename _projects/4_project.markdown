Inspired by “Booby Trap”,  [Adheli Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adheligonzalez/) and I designed springit. It is an educational toy designed to engage children in learning simple addition and subtraction of single digit numbers. Based on the idea of puzzles and problem-solving, it utilizes the basic counting principle in math following the ideas of common education core and Montessori systems.


> Portable.. Educational.. Safe..

To make this toy portable and easy to store, the drawer (secured with latches) was given a handle that helps open and
close the drawer and can be used to carry the toy like a briefcase (with all of the blocks inside) when the child is done
playing with it. Many children play with iPads and are comfortable with its size, so springit. was made to be the size of an
iPad, to fit on the child’s lap or table. For space efficiency and child’s safety, the detailing on the number blocks was made
to be concave so the bricks could be stackable inside the drawer, while not taking away from the sensorial aspect of
counting.
