For my Computer & Graphics Design (MECE3408) midterm, we were asked to reverse engineer the toy truck seen below. This toy, along with many others from the same line, are very popular with children and parents alike for their interactivity and safety. 

For this project, we were required design the truck, including all of it's components, as accurately as possible. We were allowed a number of simplifications which were limited to non-functional features. This meant that the number of parts could not be reduced, however, their decals and features could be.

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

This reverse-engineering process began with taking categorizing the parts, taking their measurements, and producing sketches which could be used for the CAD process.
