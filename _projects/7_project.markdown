For our freshman Art of Engineering class, we designed a game for our final project. Initially the idea was to design a maze game on an LED screen and provide the graphics for that. However, due to a shortage in LED screens at the time (at adafruit, probably because the entire class bought out the whole stock) we improvised by using a continued led strip block. We designed a "blind" maze which works similarly to minesweeper. There exists a path, which lights up in green when you follow it correctly, and walls which turn red when you hit them.
