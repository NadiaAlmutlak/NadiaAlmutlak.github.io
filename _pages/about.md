Hello! I'm Nadia. I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Columbia University. I'm a [KGSP](https://kgsp.kaust.edu.sa/) scholarship recepient. I'm currently interning as a part of [RISS](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) in the [HARP Lab](http://harp.ri.cmu.edu/). I'm very passionate about designing tools to advance rehabilitation and help people relearn, restore, or improve functional movements to allow them to return to activities of daily living.
